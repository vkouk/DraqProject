        <p class="questionnaire-text">This is a simple questionnaire that only takes two minutes to complete.
            At the end of the test, you will be placed in a risk zone that will help you find out if have type
            2 diabetes or if you are a candidate of having prediabetes.It is possible to have prediabetes or
            undiagnosed type 2 diabetes without having or going through any distinct warning signs or symptoms.
            <br>Knowing your risk zone is imperative in order to improve your health life choices and eventually
            reduce or prevent the risk of developing diabetes.

            This risk assessment questionnaire was created by Professor J. Tuomilehto of the Public Health Department
            of the University of Helsinki and Dr J. L. Lindstrom of the Finnish National Healthcare Institution for the
            Finnish Diabetes Association and was later given to and modified by the Greek Diabetes Association.<br> It was given
            to us by the Greek Diabetes Association. We would like to thank every individual and group that has been involved
            in the making of this questionnaire, we greatly appreciate everything theyâ€™ve done.
